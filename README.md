# MyNotes

A web application for writing down your thoughts!

Yeah, it's *scientifically proven* that writing down your thoughts leads to mental and physical improvements! Do it! :-)

My first Rails web application, to tinker with:

* the Rails architecture, obv.
* minitest
* faker
* kaminari
* font-awesome-rails
* smacss + scss + bem
* haml
* some jquery for displaying flash messages
* deployment on digital ocean
* nginx configuration
